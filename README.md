# Stock Market Performance Analysis

Stock Market Performance Analysis involves calculating moving averages, measuring volatility, conducting correlation analysis, and analyzing various aspects of the stock market to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect stock prices and the relationships between the stock prices of different companies.

## Overview

This Python project utilizes libraries such as Pandas, yfinance, NumPy, and Plotly Express to analyze the stock market performance of four companies: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG). The analysis includes:

- Downloading historical stock price data for the last three months.
- Visualizing stock prices using line and faceted area charts.
- Analyzing moving averages to identify trends and patterns.
- Examining volatility to understand price fluctuations.
- Conducting correlation analysis between stock prices of different companies.

## Getting Started

1. Install required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas yfinance numpy plotly
    ```

2. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    Stock Market Performance Analysis.py
    ```

## Results

Explore the stock market performance results using Plotly Express charts and moving averages analysis. The project provides insights into trends, volatility, and correlations between companies.

## Moving Averages

Moving averages help identify trends and patterns in each company‚Äôs stock price movements over time. The project visualizes moving averages for each company.

## Volatility Analysis

Volatility is measured to understand how much and how often the stock price or market fluctuates. High volatility indicates larger price movements, while low volatility suggests smaller or less frequent movements.

## Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis examines the relationships between stock prices of different companies. The project includes scatter plots with trendlines to visualize correlations.

## Note

- When the MA10 crosses above the MA20, it's considered a bullish signal.
- When the MA10 crosses below the MA20, it's considered a bearish signal.
- Strong correlations indicate similar price movements between companies.
